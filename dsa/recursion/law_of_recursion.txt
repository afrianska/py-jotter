# The Three Laws of Recursion

Like the robots of Asimov, all recursive algorithms must obey three important laws:

1. A recursive algorithm must have a base case.

2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.

3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.
