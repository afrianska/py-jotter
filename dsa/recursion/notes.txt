The key points to remember:
- All recursive algorithms must have a base case.
- A recursive algorithm must change its state and make progress toward the base case.
- A recursive algorithm must call itself (recursively).
- Recursion can take the place of iteration in some cases.
- Recursive algorithms often map very naturally to a formal expression of the problem you are trying to solve
- Recursion is not always the answer. Sometimes a recursive solution may be more computationally expensive than an alternative algorithm.
